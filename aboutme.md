This website willserve as my personal portfolio, showcasing a collection of my projects within this course. 
It highlights my work, creativity, and (most importantly) growth while acting as a central space to share what I’ve built and explored.”

### Future of this Website?

It requires a lot of polishing, but I hope to add many more things that reflect who I am. 
In other words, fill in the gaps and make this website look and feel more complete!
